# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove the Caffeine watermark attribution from all pages of the application.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove the "Built with using caffeine" attribution text and link from the Footer component
- Ensure footer layout remains properly formatted after removal
- Verify the updated footer displays correctly across all pages (home, join, schedule, gallery, info, links, about, contact, top10)

**User-visible outcome:** Users will see a cleaner footer without the Caffeine.ai attribution on all pages of the application.
