  "summary": "The diff shows successful implementation of REQ-1. The hero section image in Home.tsx has been updated to use '/assets/Fish Edit.png' as the src attribute, replacing the previous logo. The image maintains responsive sizing with className 'w-full max-w-xl sm:max-w-2xl h-auto', includes opacity transitions, and is properly centered within the hero layout. The existing flag motifs (left_flag.png and right_flag.png) remain unchanged as decorative elements. No missing requirements or hallucinated features detected.",
