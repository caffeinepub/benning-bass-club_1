  "summary": "The diff implements most requirements correctly. REQ-1 through REQ-9 are addressed in frontend/src/pages/Top10.tsx with the new standings table, columns, styling, badges, and alignment. REQ-10 is partially addressed: the average fish size tracker was removed from Home.tsx, but the hook file useAverageCatchSize.ts still exists (potentially unused). The diff is truncated, so some details like mobile horizontal scrolling implementation and subtle first-place highlighting cannot be fully verified.",
