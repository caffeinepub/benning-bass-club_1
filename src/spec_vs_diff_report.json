  "summary": "The BuildRequest required removing the Caffeine watermark from the Footer component. The diff shows the Footer.tsx file has been modified and no longer contains any 'Built with using caffeine' attribution text or link. The footer maintains its three-column layout structure with club info, quick links, and connect sections, along with a properly formatted bottom bar containing only the copyright notice. The footer-file-summaries.txt confirms the footer is used across all pages via the Layout component, ensuring the removal applies site-wide.",
